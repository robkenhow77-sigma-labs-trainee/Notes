# TDD

### Test driven development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that involves writing automated tests before the code that will be tested. It follows the process of:
- Write a test: Write a unit test that describes a desired feature or behavior. This test should fail because the feature hasn't been implemented yet. 
- Write code: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass. 
- Refactor: Refactor the code to improve its structure and quality while ensuring the test still passes. 
- Repeat: Repeat the process with a new test case.

### Pytest

Pytest is the module used for testing functions. To run tests create a file called: ``` 'test_filename.py' ```
to run: ```pytest test_filename``` 

### Basic testing

### Raising errors

### Parameterised

### Mocking 

### Patching
